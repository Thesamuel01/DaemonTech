### Repository Information

This repository serves as an aggregator for two primary subprojects that are part of the same C# solution: the Technical Challenge Project and the Unit Tests Project. It does not contain any actual code or files for these subprojects directly, but acts as a central hub to organize and manage them under one umbrella.

### Cloning the Repository

To access the individual subprojects and contribute to the overall C# solution, you need to perform the following steps to ensure that all the submodules are properly initialized and updated after the initial clone operation:

**Step 1:** Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Thesamuel01/DaemonTech.git
```

**Step 2:** Initialize and update the submodules using the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

By following these steps, you will clone the entire repository along with all the submodules, including the Technical Challenge Project and the Unit Tests Project. After initializing the submodules, you can explore and work with these specific subprojects as needed.
