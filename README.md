# DaemonTech

### Repository Information

This repository serves as an aggregator for two primary subprojects that are part of the same C# solution: the Technical Challenge Project and the Test Project. It does not contain any actual code or files for these subprojects directly, but acts as a central hub to organize and manage them under one umbrella.

### Cloning the Repository

To access the individual subprojects and contribute to the overall C# solution, you need to perform a simple `git clone` operation. This will clone the entire repository along with all the submodules present within it, including the Technical Challenge Project and the Test Project. Once cloned, you can explore and work with these specific subprojects as needed.

**Cloning Command:**

git clone git@github.com:Thesamuel01/DaemonTech.git
